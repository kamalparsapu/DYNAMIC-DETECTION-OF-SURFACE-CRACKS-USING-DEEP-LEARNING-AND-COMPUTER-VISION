# DYNAMIC-DETECTION-OF-SURFACE-CRACKS-USING-DEEP-LEARNING-AND-COMPUTER-VISION
This project focuses on utilizing deep learning and computer vision techniques for crack detection in structural elements. We have employed three state-of-the-art deep learning architectures: ResNet v2, VGG16, and Xception, along with transfer learning, to classify surface cracks with high accuracy.
